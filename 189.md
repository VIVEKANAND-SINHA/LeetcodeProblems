# [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/)

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`

**Follow up:**

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?

# first apporach

```python


class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        results = [i for i  in nums]
        length = len(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            nums[(i+k)%length] = results[i]


```

# 0(1) space complexity

```python

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        k = k % len(nums)
        def reverse(left,right):
            while left<right:
                nums[left],nums[right] = nums[right],nums[left]
                left += 1
                right -= 1
        reverse(0,len(nums)-1)
        reverse(0,k-1)
        reverse(k,len(nums)-1)


```
